       My name is Chao-Zhong Qin, a full Professor of School of Resources and Safety Engineering at Chongqing University, engaged in both teaching and research. I received my bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Xi'an Jiaotong University, my master's degree in Fluid Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China, and my Ph.D. in Geosciences (Hydrology and Hydrogeology Research Group) from Utrecht University in the Netherlands. I have accumulated extensive professional knowledge and research experience in porous media, fluid flow, and numerical simulations, with 10 years of study and work experience abroad.
      My research focuses on flow and transport phenomena in diverse porous media, including geological formations and artificial materials. I am dedicated to developing image-based numerical models, advancing digital rock physics, and building cutting-edge numerical tools to gain deep insights into pore-scale physics. My work aims to bridge the gap between pore-scale and average-scale processes in porous media. Key applications include unconventional oil and gas recovery, fuel cells, sequestration of carbon dioxide, underground hydrogen storage, and design of porous materials.
